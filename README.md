# Pokemon Weakness Calculator
A libary(and basic cli) that uses pokeApi to determine the weaknesses and resistances of a given pokemon.
## Library usage
To use the library, import and call the function `GetPokemonTypeInteraction`.
## CLI usage
The cli is very barebones and was intended to be used for personal testing. To run the exectuable use the pokemon name as the first arg.

example: `./main pikachu`
